# HydroDLAdj
This code is for an adjoint-based differentiable model to enable implicit ODE solutions for large-scale hydrological modeling, reducing the distortion of fluxes and physical parameters caused by numerical errors in previous models that used explicit and operation-splitting schemes. Please follow the provided examples to use this code. If you find this code useful for your research, please cite the papers listed below.
